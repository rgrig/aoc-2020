# aoc-2020

I first solved the tasks in Python, because I did want to do them quickly.
Then, I did them in Rust because I wanted to gain some experience with it.
In general, the Rust solutions are better.
Occasionally, I was considerably slowed down by the borrow checker.
But, most of the time it was easy to pacify it.

For Rust, I was in no hurry and I had the benefit of having done it before.
So, the Rust solutions should be better.
They also tend to be quicker than the Pyhton ones.
But they did take me considerably longer to write.

I'd like to also do an Erlang rewrite so that I can learn that language.
To be able to do that, I need to make some progress on Simon's Erlang MOOC.
Maybe in 2021.

FWIW, a few days are recorded (quite boring, really):
