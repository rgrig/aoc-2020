# aoc-2020

I first solved the tasks in Python, because I did want to do them quickly.
Then, I did them in Rust because I wanted to gain some experience with it.
In general, the Rust solutions are better.
Occasionally, I was considerably slowed down by the borrow checker.
But, most of the time it was easy to pacify it.

I'd like to also do an Erlang rewrite so that I can learn that language.
To be able to do that, I need to make some progress on Simon's Erlang MOOC.
Maybe in 2021.
